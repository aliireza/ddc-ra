# Scheduling - A Secret Sauce For Resource Disaggregation

This repo contains the source code for a constraint-based ([Gecode][gecode-website])  framework describe in [here][technical-report-link]. 

- **DDC-RA** The framework for finding the optimal memory allocation in an extended rack-scale architecture.
- **CPU-RA** The source code for a NUCA-aware CPU allocator. 

Each folder has a `Makefile` that can be used to compile the source code. 

## Requirement

You need to install [Gecode][gecode-website] to be able to use our source code. A quick recepie would be to run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgecode-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rock-core/qt4
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libqtcore4 libqt4-dev
sudo ldconfig
```

Note that Gecode also requires QT libraries. For more information, please refer to the [Gecode documentation][gecode-doc]. 

## Citing our technical report

If you use our framework in any context, please cite our [technical report][technical-report-link]:

We show that an Service LevelObjective (SLO)-aware constraint-based solver could improve a data centerâ€™s resource utilization by finding better solutions based on provided workload characteristics. },
